# Project Recipes API 🥗

I implemented an API for managing recipes, users, and culinary comments. The application provides endpoints to list recipes, get specific details, add, update, and delete recipes, as well as similar operations for users. It also allows users to add comments to recipes. The HTTP responses indicate the success or failure of the operations.

The files that were changed during the development of the endpoints were:

- `RecipeController.cs`: Implementation of GET, POST, PUT and DELETE endpoints related to recipes.
- `UserController.cs`: Implementation of GET, POST, PUT and DELETE endpoints related to users.
- `CommentController.cs`: Implementation of the POST endpoint related to comments.
